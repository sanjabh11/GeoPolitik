PRD Addendum: Game Theory Resource Integration for Web App
This addendum specifies the integration plan, technical design, and user stories for enhancing your web app with comprehensive game theory books and video resources. It provides actionable API endpoints and workflows to ensure your platform can surface the right resources—both open access and copyrighted—when needed, via seamless online retrieval.

1. Scope & Product Goal
Deliver an intuitive, AI-powered platform where users (students, educators, analysts) can:

Instantly access open-access game theory books, with full search and reading experience.

Discover and interact with metadata, summaries, and legal links/samples for commercial/copyrighted books.

View, search, and embed leading YouTube game theory lecture series and explainers, drawn from curated playlists.

Surface contextually relevant resources in response to user journeys, dashboards, and LLM-driven content.

2. User Stories (Addendum)
User Story A: Open Access Game Theory Books
As a student or educator
I want to search, read, and annotate open-access game theory books directly on the platform
So that I can learn or teach core concepts without legal/restriction barriers

Acceptance Criteria:

Full-text reading interface (PDF/HTML) for open-access books like Bonanno’s "Game Theory"12.

Book/section/keyword search via REST endpoint.

In-module recommendations (e.g., "Read Section 2.1: Nash Equilibrium" while doing a Nash calculator tutorial).

User Story B: Discover & Link Commercial Game Theory Books
As a professional or advanced learner
I want to browse, search, and access metadata, summaries, and sample pages of all major game theory books
So that I can find and obtain the most relevant references with proper copyright compliance

Acceptance Criteria:

Pull and display book metadata, covers, and TOC using Google Books API34567.

Summarize and show sample content if available (“Preview” via embedded Google Books Viewer).

Provide links to purchase or library access for restricted books.

API and content sections to trigger content suggestions as needed by module context.

User Story C: Game Theory YouTube Lectures & Explainers
As a learner (all personas)
I want to watch leading game theory lectures and explainer videos within course modules
So that I can augment my understanding visually and engage more deeply

Acceptance Criteria:

Dynamic surfacing of the right playlist/video in response to LLM recommendations or lesson steps (e.g., Ben Polak's Yale course8, Stanford's Algorithmic Game Theory).

YouTube Data API integration to fetch, search, and embed playlists/videos9101112.

Progress analytics and timestamps saved for user resumption.

Curate, rate, and collect community recommendations (e.g., MinutePhysics, Veritasium).

3. Integration & API Workflow Plan
3.1. Open Access Book Handling
Backend:

Host full open-access PDFs or mirror stable external links (e.g., Bonanno’s or MIT Press Open Access texts).

Index table of contents and sections: /api/books/<book_id>/toc, /api/books/<book_id>/section/<section_id>

Keyword search: /api/books/search?q=<keyword>

Frontend:

PDF/HTML reader with annotation/bookmarking features.

Integrate module-driven recommendations (e.g., direct user to relevant book section when learning Nash equilibria).

3.2. Commercial/Restricted Book Metadata
Google Books API: Query metadata, cover, and preview links.

Example endpoint: /api/catalogue/book/search?q=<title or author>

Raw Google Books API: GET https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes?q=<query>

Frontend:

Display metadata, preview, and “where to buy/borrow” links.

Trigger in-module suggestions (“Explore further: Theory of Games and Economic Behavior”).

3.3. YouTube Lectures Integration
YouTube Data API v3:

Search by keywords: /api/videos/search?q=<game theory>

Fetch playlists: /api/videos/playlist/<playlist_id>

Direct API Example: GET https://www.googleapis.com/youtube/v3/playlistItems?playlistId=<id>&key=<API_KEY>

Frontend:

Embed iframe player for lecture videos/playlists913101112.

Search/discover functionality via topic, instructor, or channel.

Track user progress and recommendations downstream into LLM or user dashboards.

4. Example API Endpoints Summary
Resource Type	Example API Endpoint	Purpose
Open-Access Books	/api/books/bonanno-game-theory	Serve or search open-access PDF/sections
Book Metadata	/api/catalogue/book/search?q=<query>	Pull metadata from Google Books API
Commercial Book Link	/api/catalogue/book/theory-games-von-neumann	Show summary, library/purchase options
YouTube Playlists	/api/videos/playlist/game-theory-ben-polak	Fetch or embed lecture series
YouTube Search	/api/videos/search?q=game theory explained	Surface explainer videos dynamically
Book/Video Suggestions	/api/suggested-resources?module=coalition-games	LLM-driven in-context resource recommendation
5. Compliance & Permissions
Open-access: Fully embed, serve, and index (with license notice).

Copyrighted: Only metadata/summary/previews, with clear links to legal resources.

YouTube: Official embedding via API—no scraping or unauthorized downloads.

6. LLM/Frontend Integration Guidance
LLMs can suggest the right resource via context (e.g., when a student struggles, recommend a related video or book section).

Frontend can call /api/suggested-resources?context=<current lesson> and receive tailored links to books, previews, and videos.

7. Example User Flow
User studies Nash equilibrium in a course module.

The system calls /api/books/search?q=Nash equilibrium.

Frontend renders Bonanno’s section on Nash — if open access, displays it inline; if not, shows metadata and preview/purchase link.

LLM suggests Yale Course video; /api/videos/search?q=Ben Polak Nash equilibrium.

User watches embedded video, resumes reading, and records progress.

8. References & Implementation Resources
Open-access Game Theory books (Bonanno, Osborne/Rubinstein)12.

Google Books API for commercial/copyrighted works34567.

YouTube Data API for lecture/playlist integration913101112.

Sample code and integration guides are available for each API.

This PRD addendum ensures your platform will deliver robust, scalable, and legal access to the best-in-class game theory educational content and video lectures—maximizing learning impact while remaining API-driven and extensible.
